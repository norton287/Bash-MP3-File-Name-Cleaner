# Bash-MP3-File-Name-Cleaner
A simple bash script to semi-clean up MP3 file names from the random MP3 taggers that seem to want to add underscores and and dashes and crap like that.  Not sure why people like that but a clean file name is not a big request from a developer when they write a program.
